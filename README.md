<h3 align = center> Pre-Tested C Codebase for University Students</h3>


> CCpy is a repository offering a collection of pre-tested, working C programs designed for students.
<br/>
This repository aids students in learning and understanding various C programming concepts, providing practical examples for assignments, projects, and exams.
<br/>
Additionally, it showcases my C language learning and helps university students by offering code examples.

## Navigation

Navigating through the repository is straightforward, thanks to a clear hierarchical structure:

| Level |                     Concept                      |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|
|   1   |                      Files                       |
|   2   |                Structs and Unions                 |
|   3   |                      Strings                      |
|   4   |                     Pointers                      |
|   5   |                      Arrays                       |
|   6   |                     Functions                     |
|   7   |       Loops (`while`, `do..while`, `for`)        |
|  8.1  |  Flow Control (`switch`, `goto`, `ternary (:?)`) |
|  8.2  | Flow Control (Branching) (`if`, `else`, `else if`)|
|   9   |    Default (Anything Not Otherwise Mentioned)     |

Each level has a dedicated directory. Related levels, such as 8.1 and 8.2, share a parent folder with subfolders.

> ### Example Usage

> To find a program involving functions, arrays, and loops:

> 1. **Arrays**: Start with the **_arrays_** directory.
> 2. **Functions**: Next, check the **_functions_** directory.
> 3. **Loops**: Finally, explore the **_loops_** directory.

> This path would look like: **Arrays > Functions > Loops > program.c**

## Compiling and Running

To use the programs, ensure you have a C compiler like GCC installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/sahil-shefeek/ccpy.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

    ```shell
    cd ccpy
    ```

3. Compile and run a program (e.g., `program.c`):

    ```shell
    gcc program.c
    ./a.out
    ```

    For Windows users:

    ```shell
    gcc program.c
    a.exe
    ```

 Each program is in a file with a descriptive name. To use a program:

>  1. Open the file (e.g., `program.c`) in a text editor.
>  2. Review the comments and code to understand its functionality.
>  3. Modify as needed or use it as a reference for your projects.
>  4. Save changes and follow the compilation instructions above.
